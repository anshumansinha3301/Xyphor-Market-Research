## 9  |  Five-Forces & Competitive Outlook (abridged)

* **Rivalry:** Intensifying—legacy giants Bajaj & TVS now out-innovating start-ups on cost & service.
* **Supplier Power:** Falling as ACC plants go on-stream (\~50 GWh by 2027).
* **Buyer Power:** High; VAHAN data makes price-vs-range transparent.
* **Threat of Substitutes:** Low for urban commuters; metro & ride-hail fill gaps.
* **Threat of New Entrants:** Rising regulatory barriers post-FAME audits.

---

## 10  |  Strategic Recommendations

1. **OEMs:**

   * Localise cells (LFP) via PLI tie-ups; target <₹80k retail price band.
   * Offer 8-yr battery warranty + guaranteed residual value to tackle resale anxiety.
2. **Component Makers:**

   * Invest in BMS & power electronics; domestic content mandates rising to 60 %.
3. **Charging Infra & Swapping:**

   * Focus on Tier-2/3 clusters with <5 km node spacing; leverage battery subscription revenue.
4. **Policymakers:**

   * Taper subsidies gradually; prioritise GST parity (28 % → 12 %).
   * Enforce AIS-156 Phase-3 safety and clamp-down on unregistered 250 W imports.

### 📌 Executive Summary

India’s E2W market rocketed from **1.6 × 10³** units in 2018 to **1.1 × 10⁶** units in 2024, powered by subsidies, smartphone-like tech appeal and gig-economy demand. A sharp subsidy rollback in 2023 tested resilience but catalysed consolidation. With domestic cell manufacturing, falling battery costs and aggressive state policies, electric scooters and bikes are on track to dominate at least half of India’s two-wheeler market by 2030.
